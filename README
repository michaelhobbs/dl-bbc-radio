Chrome extension wrapping basic functionality of get_iplayer CLI on bbc.co.uk/sounds pages.

Screenshots:
TODO

Features:
- Uses a 'dl-bbc-radio' preset which can configure the output directory for recordings, with an optional subdirectory template.
- Access to the CLI's logs.
- Recordings status and task queue.
- bbc.co.uk/sounds pages are enhanced with download buttons on radio programmes to trigger recording tasks.

Known Limitations:
- Browsers installed as snaps are not compatible due to snap app confinement. More info at: https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/chrome-gnome-shell-does-not-work-with-chromium-snap/3377/2 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/1741074');
- Not tested on Windows / Mac or with browsers other than Vivaldi. Although with little effort support could be added.
- Uses manifest v2, will need updating to v3 at some point in the near future. This will mean migrating from a background script to a serviceWorker.
- Frontend is plain JS, could use some cleanup and refactoring.
- The logs page only collects logs of native messages which were received after the log page was opened. Historical logs are not stored.

Requirements:
- get_iplayer: https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/installation
- Chrome-based browser (others not tested)
- Linux OS (others not tested)
- python3 to run the native host application

Installation (linux):
- download this repository
- update the HOST_PATH in ./host/dl.bbc.radio.json to the path the extension was downloaded to (eg: "path": "/home/michael/projects/web/dl-bbc-radio/nativeMessaging/host/dl-bbc-radio-host",)
- copy ./host/dl.bbc.radio.json to the Chrome's NativeMessagingHosts directory (eg: /home/michael/.config/vivaldi/NativeMessagingHosts)
- open in browser chrome://extensions
- enable developer mode
- load unpacked, select ./app directory
./host/install_host.* files are from the Chrome native messaging example project. Maybe the install_host.bat script will install the NativeMessagingHosts on Windows. See README.txt

Extending functionality:
To change get_iplayer recording settings, consider adding user preferences, or editing the 'dl-bbc-radio' preset via get_iplayer CLI.
To add new get_iplayer commands:
- add the command to the commands.py COMMAND_MAP
- add an optional regex for the command args
- add a command handler function in commands.py
- add an optional messageHandler class to convert raw command logs to JSON to be consumed by the JS part of the extension in commands.py
- implement a way to trigger the command from the browser (see main.html for an example of input field to trigger commands manually)
- implement the browser-side logic in background.js to handle the native messages
